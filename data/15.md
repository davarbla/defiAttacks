## Price Feed

### Description:

Blockchain “on-chain” oracles are critical to the functioning of much Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. 

Lending protocols crucially depend on oracles for their price feeds, and if these oracles are driven by on-chain exchanges, their price feed can be manipulated by bad actors to attack the lending protocols.

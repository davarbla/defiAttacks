## Interlocking Directorate

### Description:

Interlocking directorates refers to when a member of a company's board of directors also serves on another company's board or within the company's management.

Under antitrust legislation, interlocking directorates are not illegal as long as the corporations involved do not compete with each other.

The phenomenon of interlocking directorates could also have **undesirable effects on the DeFi Protocols**. Having directors holding multiple directors necessarily concentrates corporate power among a smaller group of people.

## Insecure Frond-end

### Description:

Hackers are increasingly targeting the front-end websites of DeFi protocols in a bid to steal users’ funds. 

In this attack, the hacker compromises the website or domain name to redirect unwitting users or their transactions to a malicious destination. If the user signs the transaction on the attacker’s website thinking it genuine website, in this case, the attacker can steal all of the users assets from the wallet.

## Governance Attacks:

### Description:

Managing and implementing changes to cryptocurrency blockchains via voting is called governance. Changes to a blockchain protocol are implemented through this type of governance. Each token holder can vote to accept or reject proposed modifications by developers through code updates.

Suppose an attacker is able to manipulate any blockchain projects 
that use decentralized governance structures by gaining enough voting 
rights to reshape the rules or influence enough token holders to have 
biased votes on a proposal. In that case, it could be called a *governance attack*.

In recent times, governance attacks have become commonplace, and itâ€™s
 through these kinds of attacks that hackers generally try to drain out 
the liquidity from the protocol.

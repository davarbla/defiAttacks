## Sandwich Attack

### Description:

In a sandwich attack, a nefarious trader looks for a pending transaction on the network of their choice, e.g., Ethereum. The sandwiching occurs by placing one order right before the trade and one right after it. In essence, the attacker will [front-run](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/front-running) and back-run simultaneously, with the original pending transaction sandwiched in between.

The purpose of placing these two orders and surrounding pending transactions is to manipulate asset prices. First, the culprit will buy the asset the user is swapping to — e.g., using LINK to exchange to ETH — with their knowledge of ETH's price increasing. Then, the culprit will buy ETH for a lower price in order to let the victim buy at a higher value. The attacker will then sell ETH at a higher price afterward.

### Remediation:

For AMMs, it is crucial to develop countermeasures capable of protecting users from sandwich attacks.  For example, the 1inch platform [introduced](https://help.1inch.io/en/articles/5300755-what-are-flashbot-transactions-and-how-do-they-work-on-1inch#:~:text=Flashbot%20transactions%20are%20now%20available,running%20and%20%22sandwich%20attacks%22.&text=In%20a%20nutshell%2C%20a%20front,to%20intercept%20a%20large%20transaction.) 
a  new order type known as "flashbot transactions,” which are not visible in the mempool as they are never broadcasted to it. Instead, the 1inch platform has a direct connection to trustworthy miners to make transactions visible after they are mined.

## Smurfing

### Description:

Smurfing is a money-laundering technique involving the structuring of large amounts of cash into multiple small transactions.
Smurfs often spread these small transactions over many different  accounts, to keep them under regulatory reporting limits and avoid 
detection.

In the Blockchain world, an attacker can easily create multiple wallets and can send small transactions over these wallets.

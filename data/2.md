## Social Engineering

### Description:

Social engineering techniques rely on human vulnerabilities, not the technical prowess of a potential hacker. Social engineering is used to gain (unauthorized) access to sensitive data, cryptocurrency wallets, or accounts, or to induce victims to download malware onto computers and networks to enact further damage.

Even if a protocol and its interface are secure, malicious users can log into Discords and Telegrams, pretending to be core team members and trick users into accessing fake websites or opportunities.

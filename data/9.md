## Flash Loan Attacks

### Description:

A flash loan attack is an abuse of the smart contract security of a particular platform in which an attacker usually borrows a lot of funds that don’t require collateral. They then manipulate the price of a crypto asset on one exchange and quickly resell it on another one.

Flash loan attacks are the most common types of DeFi attacks since they are the cheapest to pull off and easiest to get away with.
